# Analysis and Comparison of Application Architecture: Monolith

[Diploma thesis pdf](./thesis.pdf)

Microservices architecture is widely today used to design and develop applications.
However, developers do not always use this architecture correctly which may lead to
performance or management issues, or issues with application sustainability. The goal
of this work is to compare application design practices using the classic monolithic
architecture and microservices architecture and further explore hybrid design
approaches.
The work will include the following parts:

- Analysis of monolithic, microservices, and modular architecture design approaches and
their comparison along the lines of performance, maintainability, sustainability, and
testability.
- Design of a methodology to design and develop applications for new projects.
- Veriﬁcation and evaluation of the proposed methodology in a sample project (Proof of
Concept, PoC) which will include the implementation of a sample application.
