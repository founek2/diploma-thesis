\chapter{Architectures}
In this chapter we will look into classical Monolithic architecture, currently what is considered the most famous called Microservices and what can be found somewhere between: Modulith and Service-Oriented architecture. Apart from defining the architectures, we will compare them among the following lines:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Performance defining how much workload application can handle, how much latency is present during processing and how well application can scale.
    \item Maintainability defining how well application is understood, repaired and enhanced.
    \item Sustainability
    \item Testability defining the extent of how easy of challenging it is to test an application.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Case study}
\label{chapter:personal_experience}
In this chapter we will have a closer look on one of the project I've worked, which was build using Microservices architecture from the start. I will share my experience from position of backend developer on what it means to work on Microservices architecture alone and in a team. What are the downsides and upsides for developers and the whole application cycle (planning, implementing, bug fixing and deployment).
