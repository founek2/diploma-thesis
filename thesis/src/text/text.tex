\chapter{Architectures}
\ref{chapter:architectures}
In this chapter we will look into classical Monolithic architecture, currently what is considered the most famous called Microservices and what can be found somewhere between: Modulith and Service-Oriented architecture. Apart from defining the architectures, we will compare them among the following lines:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Performance defines how much workload application can handle, how much latency is present during processing and how well application can scale.
    \item Maintainability defines degree to which application is understood, repaired and enhanced from technological perspective.  \cite{SOFTWARE_MAINTAINABILITY}
    \item Sustainability defines how well application performs in long term from business perspective (mainly cost).
    \item Testability defines the extent of how easy or challenging it is to test an application.
    \item Complexity defines how complicated it is to understand the architecture, deployment cycle and implement changes.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Case study real application}
\label{chapter:personal_experience}
In this chapter we'll take a closer look at one of the projects I've worked on that was built from the ground up using a microservices architecture. And also on one of my personal projects that I have converted to microservices and later to Modulith. I will share my experience from the position of a backend developer on what it means to work on microservices architecture alone and in a team.  What are the downsides and upsides for developers and the whole application cycle (planning, implementing, bug fixing and deployment).

\chapter{Choosing the right architecture}
In software engineering there is no silver bullet. Every project has its spec own specifics and requirements. Some solution can work greatly for one project and be catastrophic for others. In following text, we will look closely on architecture decision-making for projects and try to come up with straight forward methodology.
